Postmortem: The Curious Case of the Sluggish Database

Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: August 22, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 UTC
Impact: Our beloved portfolio site decided to take an unscheduled coffee break, slowing down by 80% and leaving about 40% of users wondering if they had suddenly moved to a parallel universe where time moves much slower. Pages were loading like they were coming from the '90s, and users experienced timeouts when trying to view projects or submit contact forms.
Root Cause: Turns out, the database had a secret hobby—inefficient queries introduced by a sneaky schema migration.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: 🚨 Alert! Monitoring system screams, “Something is slow... very slow!”

Detection: Spotted by our trusty performance monitoring tool, waving its red flag of doom.
14:05 UTC: 🕵️‍♂️ Initial detective work begins.

Action Taken: We checked server health—CPU, memory, disk—all looked healthy, but something smelled fishy in the logs.
14:30 UTC: 👀 Engineer spots a database query going rogue.

Action Taken: Deep dive into recent database changes; found a new schema migration lurking in the shadows.
14:45 UTC: 🤔 Assumed it was just a server having a bad day.

Misleading Path: Thought it was due to a spike in traffic, so we scaled up servers... but no luck.
15:00 UTC: 📞 “Call in the database gurus!”

Escalation: Database team gets a call. We needed their magic touch for a deep-dive forensic analysis.
15:30 UTC: 💡 Eureka! It’s the queries, stupid!

Action Taken: Identified that a recent schema change caused inefficient queries. Rolled back and optimized.
16:00 UTC: 🎉 All systems back to normal. Crisis averted.

Resolution: Verified improved response times; everyone took a collective sigh of relief.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

The root of all evil here was a recent schema migration that introduced new indexes without accounting for how the queries would utilize them. This led to the database going into a deep existential crisis, questioning the purpose of every query, and taking its sweet time to respond.
Resolution:

The fix was as simple as rolling back the schema change to restore the old, efficient indexes. We also rewrote the queries to ensure they played nicely with the database. After the fix, a few rounds of rigorous testing confirmed that our beloved database was back to its sprightly self.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
What We Learned:
Lesson 1: Databases don’t like surprises. Always introduce changes like you would introduce your dog to a cat—slowly and carefully.
Lesson 2: Monitoring is your best friend—don’t ignore it. If it says something’s wrong, listen!
Tasks for the Future:
TODO: Set up a dedicated staging environment to stress-test any schema changes.
TODO: Add more detailed database query performance metrics to our monitoring dashboard.
TODO: Implement automated query analysis to flag any potential inefficiencies before they become a nightmare.
TODO: Create a “Database Disaster Drill” exercise to practice quick responses to future incidents.
